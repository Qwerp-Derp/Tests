# Task 1 (3 marks):

## Synopsis:

In the iOS project, we're going to be using a project manager called CocoaPods. A project manager is essentially a large storehouse of programs, which we can get well-crafted libraries from.

For this task, you have to do three things:

1. Use the correct CocoaPods commands to generate a Podfile, and import the library DiscreteMathematics (link [here](https://github.com/cszatma/DiscreteMathematics) to their GitHub repository).
2. Create a basic view using Xcode. The view must include two text inputs, one button, and one label.
3. Through using the library, output the GCD (greatest common divisor) of the two inputs to the label when the button is pressed. The two text inputs are guaranteed to be convertible to integers.

## Submission Method:

Submit the folder you completed your project in to the GitHub repository. Make sure that the folder works by re-downloading it and testing it out using Xcode. The folder name must contain your own name, so I can verify who did what.

## Marking Criteria:

- 1 mark for correct and working Podfile.
- 1 mark for creating the view.
- 1 mark for linking the storyboard and Swift code together, and for the correct output.
